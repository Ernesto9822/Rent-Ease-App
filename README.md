# Rent-Ease-App

#This is a project implementing just a simple format for users to add their ftlats information, implementing JavaScript, BootStrap and LocalStorage.
#Users can set favorite items, update their account information.
#The developed app would allow future renters to figure out what are the trade off between flats they consider to be relevant so it
will be easier for them to choose. The app has a single type of user, which is the one who look for a flat. The user is the one who
manage all flats data (insert, update, delete). The app will allow the user to browse all the flats in a user friendly fasion and he will mark and unmark flats as favourites.
